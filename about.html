            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>Capella is committed to growing the intercultural competence of students by promoting diverse learning opportunities. Nearly 1,300 students study abroad each year. Capella University Student Government provides students the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the University, gain experience in politics and represent their peers in conversations with the administration, faculty and staff. Each year, student organizations come together through multiple events that incorporate recruitment, organization growth, and celebration of our student organization community. While each area is distinctive, we work together as a 21st-century land-grant college – addressing health and wellness challenges, tackling human impacts on the environment, and better understanding human, political and social behavior and the impact of an ever-connected world. When you become a part of the College of Science, you’re investing in your future, supported by faculty and staff who all share the same goal: to accelerate science through excellence in discovery, learning and engagement. Now more than ever, science matters. Multicultural Programs is committed to providing diverse co-curricular programming and opportunities for students, faculty, and staff through educational and celebratory events and activities designed to increase awareness, promote critical understanding, and showcase the diversity of the Capella community. In addition, we offer leadership development and support to several multicultural student organizations in order to enhance their overall growth as agents of change.We believe that diversity and excellence are interdependent pillars in delivering successful co-curricular programming. Our vision is to foster an environment where members of our community feel valued, respected, and are unobstructed in their pursuit of excellence</p>
